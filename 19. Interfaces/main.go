// INTERFACES:
// Interfaces in Go work a little different than most of the other languages.
// In Go, Interfaces are not implemented explicitly.

// The idea behind Interfaces in Go is duck-typing. 
// Which simply translates into: If something looks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it must be a duck. 
// Meaning that if our object implements all duckâ€™s features then there should be no problem using it as a duck.

// Declaring the Interface Shape
type Shape interface {
	area() float64
}

// By declaring the above Interface "Shape", we're telling Go that our program has a new type called 'Shape'
// and our 'Shape' Interface defines the following behaviour/method => "area() float64"
// and if any type in the entire program implements exactly the same behavior as defined by the Interface
// meaning, if any type has an associated function called "area()" and it returns a "float64" value
// then it will be considered an honorary member of "Shape".

	length  float64

	return 0.5 * t.base * t.height

	// Since all the types namely, Rectange, Triangle and Circle have the function "area() float64" associated with them
	// They can call (use) the "printArea()" function.
